### Any database SQL/NoSQL ORM/ODM

Having the ability to seemlessly change between different databases I choose to build mine in MongoDb and use the built in document database for the testing. There is a long list of available database adapters 
- [Official](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/adapters/available-adapters#?officiallysupported-database-adapters)
- [Community](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/adapters/available-adapters#?communitysupported-database-adapters)

I found it very easy to switch between the databases and Im sure you will aswell. The only thing Ive had a hard time with was to make it work with SQLITE3, I managed eventuelly but it wasnt an easy setup like the rest of the databases.

Below is examples from my project, the first one where I implement MongoDb as the develop db
```
adapter: 'sails-mongo',
url: 'mongodb://root@localhost/chai17Ramverk2Proj'
```
And this one for testing
```
adapter: 'sails-disk',
```

### Auto-generated REST Api

This is a very powerful but slightly dangerous function. When I started to use Sails.js I did not know about this or how it worked, leaving my databse very open on all routes to read write and update as u please. However with knowledge comes power and with power great responsibility, or something alike. When you know about it and how it works, it is a great asset. 
Simply by using Sails CLI you can write

```
sails generate api User
```

This will create the Model: User and the Controller: UserController along with the RESTApi routes to handle the Model. 

- [add to](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/add-to)
- [create](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/create)
- [destroy](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/destroy)
- [find one](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/find-one)
- [find where](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/find-where)
- [populate where](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/populate-where)
- [remove from](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/remove-from)
- [update](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/update)

Model example, where attributes (or database columns if you like to look at it that way) has been added. 
```
//User Model

module.exports = {
    
    attributes: {
        firstname: {
            type: 'string',
            required: true
        },
        lastname: {
            type: 'string'
        },
        email: {
            type: 'string',
            isEmail: true,
            unique: true,
            required: true
        }
}
```


### Websocket integration

more magic coming up. Remember I told you about how things happened without me knowing it when I created my Model/Controller earlier. Well this happened aswell. How smooth is this ?
Simply make a get request on the route and you are hooked up on the websocket.
Simple as this,atleast most times:
Add a listener to the User model we created earlier.
```
io.socket.on('user', function(msg){
  console.log(msg);
})
```
Make a get request through io.socket.get on the route and you are subscribed.

```
io.socket.get('/user', function(resData) {
  console.log(resData);
});
```

Lets say someone would make a create on the Model User, then you would receive something like this in your log: 

```
{
    verb: 'created',
  id: 1,
  data: {
    id: 1,
    firstname: 'joe',
    lastname: 'Joesson',
    email: joejoe@email.com
    createdAt: '2014-08-01T05:50:19.855Z'
    updatedAt: '2014-08-01T05:50:19.855Z'
  }
}
```

How convenient, not only do you get the full info on the model, you also get what triggered the socket, in this case a create action.
